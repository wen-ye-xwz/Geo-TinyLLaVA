## Plane Geometry Diagram Formalization via Vision-Language Models

Code and data for the paper "Plane Geometry Diagram Formalization via Vision-Language Models".

Dataset [GDF86K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/1509cxt/GDF86K), Model Checkpoints [Geo-TinyLLaVA](https://huggingface.co/1509cxt/Geo-TinyLLaVA).

Notice: Here we publish the model checkpoints of GeoTinyLLaVA trained with the Predicate Commutativity 
Transformation (PCT) augmented instruction-tuning dataset ([PCT.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/1509cxt/GDF86K/blob/main/PCT.json)), which gives the best performance on Inter-GPS geometry problem solving among the 4 model checkpoints.

## Installation and Requirements

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Geo-TinyLLaVA/Geo-TinyLLaVA.git
cd Geo-TinyLLaVA 
```

2. With Python 3.10+ and python3-pip, create and activate a virtualenv environment or conda environment, or just use your system Python interpreter.

3. Install all required python dependencies of TinyLLaVA and Inter-GPS.

```bash
# enable PEP 660 support
pip install --upgrade pip  

# prerequisites of the training and inference of Geo-TinyLLaVA
cd TinyLLaVA_Factory 
pip install -e .
pip install deepspeed tokenizers transformers peft          

# prerequisites of the evaluation of geometry diagram formalization performance and geometry problem solving performance of Inter-GPS
cd ..
pip install -r InterGPS/requirement.txt      
```
4. data download and unzip

```
cd InterGPS
. data/unzip_data.sh

cd ..
# download the dataset GDF86K
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/1509cxt/GDF86K
```
